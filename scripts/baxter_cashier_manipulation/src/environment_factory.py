"""
Factory for Environments.

This file contains some  static classes that  represents  environments  in real
life. If Baxter for  example is  placed somewhere  in a real  environment let's
name it "Robotics Lab" then we wish to define  obstacles around  Baxter in this
specific  environment.  In  this  class  we  achieve  exactly  this,  for  each
environment that  Baxter can  be, we  define the obstacles around him and using
the  Factory  Pattern   and  Template  design  pattern  we  are  able  to  have
extensibility with a very nice way.

If you need to define a new environment here are the steps:

1. Define a  similar  class with the one listed below: `RoboticsLabEnvironment`
   but make sure the  obstacles  implemented in  `RoboticsLabEnvironment` match
   you own obstacles in  your  environment, and  make sure  you give a sensible
   name for the class.
2. In `EnvironmentFactory`  class,  define a top-level attribute with  the name
   of your new class (see the  one already there: `__robotics_lab_environment`)
3. Implement your getter, as like `def get_robotics_lab_environment():` and use
   similar logic to return your new class back.
4. In `moveit_controller.py` find the line
   `EnvironmentFactory.get_robotics_lab_environment()` and change it to match
   your new getter method.
